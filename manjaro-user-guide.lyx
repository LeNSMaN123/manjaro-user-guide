A note about Manjaro and Arch
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Manjaro is based on another distribution called Arch Linux.
 As such, it is also able to draw software packages from the community-maintaine
d Arch User Repository (AUR).
 However, please note that Manjaro is not Arch, and any enquiries about
 the Manjaro operating system should be directed towards the Manjaro forums
 and Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels alone.
 For example, although Ubuntu is derived from Debian - and therefore shares
 some similarities with its parent - there are still substantial differences
 between these operating systems and how they work.
 Such is the case with Manjaro, which is far from just being an

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Arch operating system.
 Here are some of the key differences between the Manjaro and Arch operating
 systems:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manjaro is developed independently from Arch, and by a completely different
 team.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manjaro is designed to be accessible to newcomers, while Arch is aimed at
 experienced users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manjaro draws software from its own independent repositories.
 These repositories also contain software packages not provided by Arch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manjaro provides its own distribution-specific tools such as the Manjaro
 Hardware Detection (MHWD) utility, and the Manjaro Settings Manager (MSM).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manjaro has numerous subtle differences in how it works when compared to
 Arch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reiterate, although Manjaro is indeed an Arch-derivative, it is not Arch!

About Manjaro

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Manjaro
\series default
 is a user-friendly
\series bold
 GNU/Linux
\series default
 distribution based on the independently developed
\series bold
 Arch Linux
\series default
.
 Within the Linux community, Arch itself is renowned for being an exceptionally
 fast, powerful, and lightweight distribution that provides access to the
 very latest cutting-edge software.
 However, Arch is also traditionally aimed at more experienced or technically-mi
nded users.
 As such, it is generally considered to be beyond the reach of many, especially
 those who lack the technical expertise (or persistence) required to use
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Developed by a worldwide team, Manjaro aims to provide all of the benefits
 of Arch Linux combined with a focus on user-friendliness and accessibility.
 Available in both 32- and 64-bit versions, Manjaro is suitable for newcomers
 as well as experienced Linux users.
 For newcomers, a user-friendly installer is provided, and the system itself
 is designed to work fully

 Two of the three official editions come complete with a pre-installed desktop
 environment and a selection of popular software applications, and either
 of these would be a great choice for anyone who wants to try out Manjaro
 on a Live-CD
\begin_inset Flex Marginnote

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When you purchase retail software it generally comes on a disc, whether
 a CD or a DVD.
 A 'Live-CD' has a version of the operating system that will run without
 needing to be installed.
 This is a feature of most GNU/Linux and BSD-based operating systems.

 without having to install it first.
 If you have the time it's worth taking each for a test run to see which
 you like best!

 a familiar desktop interface.

\begin_layout Description
Net This edition of Manjaro provides only a base installation, stripped
 of all but the most basic pre-installed software.
 Starting from the command line, this is suitable for more experienced users
 who may want to build their own Manjaro system from the ground up.
 A disc image for a Net edition will always begin with
\series bold
 manjaro-net
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each edition of Manjaro is available as 32- and 64-bit versions.
 Disc images available for 32-bit systems will end in
\series bold
 i686.iso
\series default
 and images for 64-bit systems will end in
\series bold
 x86_64.iso
\series default
.
 A 64-bit operating system won't run on a 32-bit system, and although a
 32-bit operating system will run on a 64-bit system it won't be able to
 make full use of its resources.
 Try to make sure that you download the appropriate disc image for your
 system!

Manjaro community editions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the three main Manjaro editions, there are a number of editions
 that have certain software or desktop environments preinstalled.
 This user manual assumes you are using the Xfce version, and all screenshots
 will be from this.
 However, the installation process and other software works in exactly the
 same way!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The edition names should give a clear indication of the desktop environment
 they install.
 Unless you have a strong preference, we suggest you stick with the Xfce
 version.
 You can of course change later, or install other desktop environments too!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many community editions to choose from, including: Cinnamon, GNOME,
 MATE, Netbook, Openbox, Openbox OpenRC, and PekWM.

\begin_layout Section
Downloading a disc image
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every release of Manjaro is available for download, whether the current
 stable release, upcoming test builds, or previous versions for historical
 interest.
 When you visit the download page you will find a link to each of the three
 main editions in both 32- and 64-bit versions, as well as a checksum file
 for each.
 A checksum can be used to check the integrity of the disc image file you
 download to make sure it hasn't been corrupted during the download.

) we strongly recommend that you first check that it hasn't been corrupted.
 The potential result of not checking first, especially if you want to install
 Manjaro as your main operating system, should be obvious.
 In the best case, the installation will fail.
 In the worst case a corrupted image will result in a corrupted installation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To verify the integrity of the disc image you have to download the appropriate
 checksum file.
 This will be available at the same place where you downloaded the disc
 image file.
 For example, the file
\series bold
 manjaro-xfce-15.09-rc3-x86_64-sha256sum.txt
\series default
 contains checksum hashes for all the available disc image files and will
 have content similar to this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
ce7471ddb5496abdbe484a9615ff0b6b42cedc47258aa5ad37fa5c252e28371d  manjaro-xfce-1
5.09-rc3-x86_64.iso
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
MD5 and SHA-256
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may have seen there are three checksum files.
 One ends -sha256sum.txt, one in -sha1sum.txt, and the other ends -md5sum.txt.
 MD5 and SHA are two types of hashing algorithms; the 'sha' part of the
 checksum file name stands for
\series bold
 Secure Hash Algorithm
\series default
.
 These algorithms are used to generate a hash code unique to the disc image
 file.
 The checksum file itself is just a text document that contains hash codes
 that should match the code generated by the MD5 or SHA algorithms.
 Copies of the file can be checked to make sure they are exactly the same
 - if the file is changed in any way, either intentionally or by corruption,
 the code generated will be different.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whilst MD5 is commonly used, SHA-256 is newer and more secure and is beginning
 to replace MD5.
 For the purpose of checking the integrity of the downloaded file MD5 is

If the code generated from the disc image matches that contained in the
 checksum file, then the disc image file is fine.
 If the two codes don't match then it means that the disc image file has
 changed in some way, most likely due to being corrupted.
 You can think of it like someone using a password to identify who they
 are: if they provide the wrong password, then something is probably wrong.

 against the value in the text file.
 The process should be very straightforward!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this example, I first open a terminal and change to the directory where
 I downloaded the disc image file and checksum file.
 I use the command
\family typewriter
ls
\family default
 to check which files are present:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
jonathon@box:~$ cd download
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see I have downloaded the 64-bit Xfce edition.
 Next, I run the
\family typewriter
sha1sum
\family default
 program to check against the values in the checksum file:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
jonathon@box:~/download$ sha256sum -c manjaro-xfce-15.09-rc3-x86_64-sha256sum.txt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The line shows the result of the checks.
 In this case, it shows that
\family typewriter
sha256sum
\family default
 has successfully verified the disc image I downloaded against the checksum
 value in the file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
sha256sum: manjaro-xfce-15.09-rc3-x86_64.iso: OK

A disc image is not a copy-and-paste duplication of files: it's a bit-for-bit
 copy of the raw data that makes up the files and folders of that disc.
 This is why just copying a disc image file to a disc (or USB flashdrive)
 to begin installing won't work: you'll need to use a disc burning or image
 writing application to translate that raw data into the files and folders.

There is an exception to this rule.
 If you intend on installing Manjaro in a virtual machine environment using
 Oracle's VirtualBox, then there will be no need to burn the image as VirtualBox

 For example, you will not be able to save any changes to the system, install

Booting the Live environment, whether from CD/DVD or USB flash drive, will
 give you an overview of the Manjaro Linux environment and let you test
 how well it will run on your machine.
 This is very useful to check before committing to install a new operating
 system!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For best results you should be connected to the Internet.
 If you have a wired Ethernet connection, and plug in before booting the
 Live environment, Manjaro will automatically set up a connection.
 If you have a wireless (Wi-Fi) connection you can set up the wireless network
 once you have reached the Manjaro desktop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method of selecting the boot device varies considerably across machines.
 You may need to hold one key, for example <
\series bold
Esc
\series default
>, <
\series bold
Del
\series default
>, or <
\series bold
F10
\series default
>, to select the boot device.
 Or, you may need to set the option in your BIOS.
 If you're not sure, your machine's user guide will have detail of the method
 you need, alternatively a web search will also quickly turn up the answer.

 The differences are not minor, and your choice can depend on your computer

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series bold
Free
\series default
 drivers are open-source, like Manjaro itself, written and updated by a

 For older hardware and that with Intel-based integrated graphics, this
 is the best choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series bold
Non-Free
\series default
 drivers are closed-source, written and updated only by the hardware manufacture
rs.
 This is generally the best choice for newer hardware with AMD or Nvidia
 dedicated graphics.
 At the time of writing,
\series bold
 non-Free
\series default
 drivers are the best choice for Nvidia graphics and AMD graphics newer
 than the 8000-series.
 For older AMD and Nvidia hardware the

 For AMD graphics older than the HD5000-series

\begin_layout Standard
Gparted is a graphical program used to modify partitions on drives.
 It is very powerful and yet has a very user-friendly interface.
 Partitions are sections of a drive which store data using a certain format
 named file system.
 Examples of well-known file systems are ntfs (used by Microsoft Windows),
 ext4 (used by Linux) and fat32.
 All drives, be they hard drives or flash drives such as USB keys contain
 one or more partitions.
 GParted allows you to create and delete partitons, as well as change the
 attributes, such as their size, their location on the disk and the file
 system.
 It can also create partition tables of type MBR and GPT.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
UEFI is the commonly agreed on name for both the EFI & UEFI standards which
 merged.
 It does not include the old EFI v1, or Apple's own non-standard version
 of EFI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some newer hardware do not use the well-known BIOS to manage boot options.
 Instead, a new one named UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is
 used.
 It still has BIOS-like menus and often has a legacy mode, which uses BIOS.
 UEFI often goes hand in hand with the nefarious Secure Boot option that
 makes it more difficult to boot operating systems outside of a select few.
 If your computer came with Microsoft Windows 8 or later installed, your
 computer uses UEFI and probably has Secure Boot enabled by default.
 However, the Linux community reacted to this and developped means to install
 and boot Linux on those systems as well.
 Some installers, such as Calamares, can even automate the process so it
 makes virtually no difference to the user whether their machine uses UEFI
 or BIOS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Booting in UEFI mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
The most important step is to ensure that your machine does not have Secure
 Boot enabled
\series default
.
 Only a very limited number of operating systems will boot with this enabled.
 You must disable this in your BIOS before proceeding; if you don't know
 how to do this please refer to your computer's user manual.

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have booted the system from the Live CD/USB you will be presented
 with the Manjaro boot selection screen.
 It has two main options for the drivers it will use (either Free or non-Free).
 The main difference is the lack of any option for language or keyboard
 layout.
 This is actually not that big of a problem, since these can be setup in
 the live environment and in the Calamares installer, which will make them
 permanent on the installed system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Differences in the partition setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key difference in the way the partitions are arranged compared to the
 case with BIOS is that a small partition of a few hundreds of Mbs must
 be created to house some files used when booting the system.
 Luckily, in all assisted installation options, Calamares handles the creation
 of this partition if it does not already exists and writes the necessary
 files to it.
 If the partition already exists, it is detected and used to write the files.

Once the Calamares installer is executed, the first noticeable difference

 from before, with the sda1 partition storing the files used when booting.

This guide is intended for those with limited technical knowledge and experience.
 With these steps it won't be necessary to manually partition your computer's

 However, the overall flexibility of the process is not as great as the
 advanced installation process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where possible, make sure you are connected to the internet before booting
 from your installation media into the Live environment.
 This allows the installer to update itself to the very latest available
 version.
 If you have a hard-wired connection via an Ethernet cable then Manjaro
 will automatically connect to the internet without you having to do anything.
 Otherwise, once you have booted into Manjaro's desktop, you will need to
 select and then connect to your wireless network.

 If you have a hard-wired connection via an Ethernet cable, then Manjaro
 will automatically connect to the internet without you having to do anything.
 Otherwise, once you have booted into Manjaro's desktop, you will need to
 select and then connect to your wireless network.

UEFI is the commonly agreed on name for both the EFI & UEFI standards which
 merged.
 It does not include the old EFI v1, or Apple's own non-standard version
 of EFI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have a relatively new computer (e.g.
 post-2012) it will probably have UEFI support; it certainly will if it
 came with Microsoft Windows 8 or later installed.
 At this point in time, installing a Linux distribution on a UEFI system
 can be tricky.
 Thankfully Manjaro's installer, Thus, does a good job of correctly setting
 up everything.
 However, there are still important considerations, especially when it comes
 to the partitioning table.

Once you have booted the system from the Live CD/USB you will be presented
 with the Manjaro boot selection screen.
 It has two main options for the drivers it will use (either Free or non-Free).
 The main difference is the lack of any option for language or keyboard
 layout.
 However, this is actually not that important! When you run Thus and choose
 your language and keyboard layout this will take effect within the Live
 environment, along with setting these for the installed system.

Synchronising with the Manjaro repositories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As new packages are added to the repositories you will need to regularly
 synchronise the package lists.
 This is normally taken care of automatically on a regular basis by the
 software managers, but to perform this manually type the following into
 the terminal:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman -Sy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will only download the package lists if there has been a change.
 Occasionally you may want to force the package lists to be downloaded.
 To do this, type:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman -Syy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pacman will allow you to perform an update of software already installed:

It's a good idea to check whether the package lists are up-to-date at the
 same time:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman -Syu

Searching for software

\begin_layout Standard
Finding a package by name is really straightforward.
 For example, to search for a text editor called Leafpad:

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Installing a package is equally straightforward.
 For example, to install Leafpad:

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Many software applications depend on other software packages.
 Thankfully, pacman will automatically detect and install these!

\begin_layout Subsection
Removing software
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To remove a software package you need to know its name, but the command
 is straightforward.
 To remove Leafpad:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman -R leafpad
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's also possible to remove a package and any dependencies it required
 when it was installed.
 Assuming those other packages are not being used by another piece of software,
 they will become
\series bold
 orphan
\series default
 packages.
 These serve no function other than taking up space! To remove a software
 package with its dependencies:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman -Rs leafpad
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A package may also create configuration files.
 Normally these are left in place so your configuration is not lost, and
 can be reused if you install the package again.
 However, if you want to remove these configuration files too, the command
 is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman -Rns leafpad
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If at a later date you want to remove all orphan packages and configuration
 files for packages that you removed some time ago, the following command
 will do it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qtdq)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Be warned, though: this is an advanced command!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Other pacman commands
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's a good idea to become familiar with the pacman commands.
 It can be a very useful tool in case the other software managers refuse
 to complete an installation, for example if an installation process is
 interrupted.

Sometimes, though, the list of mirrors can get old.
 New mirrors can become available, and some mirrors are removed.
 Updates to Manjaro will regularly trigger an update of the mirror list,

This will allow you to select which mirror, or mirrors, to try when checking
 for software updates and downloading new packages.
 It's normally best to choose mirrors that are geographically close to you,
 so if you're in Canada then Canadian and US servers are generally a good
 bet.
 Of course, you're free to choose whichever you want!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reset back to an automatic choice, run this command:

\begin_layout Standard
When you install Manjaro you will be using the stable branch.
 This set of packages has the most testing and so is the best for most users.
 However, you may want to help test packages before they move to the stable
 repository:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman-mirrors -g -b testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The testing repository has packages that have been checked by the Manjaro
 development team to make sure they work correctly.
 However, the amount of testing done is much smaller than for the stable
 branch - but this is how they get tested!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to live on the bleeding edge, you can switch to the unstable
 branch.
 This is normally used by the Manjaro developers.
 Packages from the unstable branch can cause problems, so this is not something
 to do lightly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman-mirrors -g -b unstable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After switching branches you will need to force an update of the package
 lists:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman -Syyu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you switch away from the stable branch, but want to move back, it's actually
 pretty easy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman-mirrors -g -b stable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will leave the newer packages on your system and these will be replaced
 as the stable branch catches up.
 However, if you want to force a downgrade of packages back to the stable
 version, use:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman -Syyuu

This means pacman thinks it is already running.
 If it is, and you try to force an installation or removal of software,
 the package database can be left in an inconsistent state.
 This would be bad.
 So, the first thing to check is whether an installer is running.
 One of the easiest ways to check is to run a terminal command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
ps x | grep pacman
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This might look complicated, but it's just two small commands joined (piped)
 together.
 First,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
ps x
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
produces a list of running processes for all users.
 Second,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
grep pacman
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
searches for the text
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pacman
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The pipe, |, takes the output from the first and feeds it to the second.
 To check whether another program is running you can just change the text
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pacman
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to something else:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
ps x | grep pamac
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
ps x | grep octopi
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you are sure an installer is not running, you can delete pacman's lock
 file:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo rm /var/lib/pacman/db.lck
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then try running the install process again!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a problem persists, there is a series of commands that will fix most
 issues:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo rm -f /var/lib/pacman/db.lck
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

sudo pacman-mirrors -g
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

sudo pacman -Syyuu
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

sudo pacman -Suu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order, these commands:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Remove pacman's lock file;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Update the mirror list;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Forces an update of the package lists and an update of any packages to bring
 them in line with the current repository state;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ensures no packages are left out of line with the current repository state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make things easier, Manjaro includes a command alias
